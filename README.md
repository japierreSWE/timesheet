# timesheet
This repository contains a web application that allows registered employees to create and edit
timesheets to record how many hours they have worked. Timesheets are stored in a MySQL database
to allow clients to access employee's timesheets.

The web application allows users to log in as either an employee or a client. Employees are able
to edit and submit timesheets for a given client.

This project was completed as a take-home project during an interview process.
